I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Weill Cornell Medicine. 

My research focuses on spatiotemporal modeling of environmental metrics, including air pollution, green space, land use, urban functions, and urban landscapes, to assess their impacts on public and mental health. I integrate spatial statistics, social media data, remote sensing, and machine learning to identify environmental risk and protective factors, with a focus on vulnerable populations, including children and older adults. 

My work bridges environmental epidemiology, urban planning, and health equity, enhancing the understanding of the interactions between environment and health outcomes.
